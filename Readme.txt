********************************************************
We have used the datasets of dog breeds from image net:

german hsepherd:

husky:

http://www.image-net.org/synset?wnid=n02109961
*******************************************************
we divided our dataset in our code into three section and 
then we have commented that part after we did it for the first
time, so it doen not do that again. 
Also we labled the husky and german shepherd data manually.
